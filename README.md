# SC KeyMappings
This repo takes the xml from StarCitizen's keymappings and breaks it down into an interactive html page displaying keybindings for Star Citizen

# Dynamic nature
This repo is using [KnockoutJS](https://knockoutjs.com) MVVM to use the javascript to drive the UI

## Requirements
You need to have a `global.ini` and the `defaultProfile.xml` file extracted from your SC datafile in order to use the python script to generate `data.js`
